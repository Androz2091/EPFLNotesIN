\parag{Equations modulo 12}{
    Let's consider the $\Mod 12$ world.

    We wonder if $\congruent{2+x}{2 + y}{12}$ implies $\congruent{x}{y}{12}$. We know $\congruent{-2}{-2}{12}$, thus: 
    \[\congruent{2+x}{2 + y}{12} \implies \congruent{x}{y}{12}\]
    
    More generally, we can add, subtract, and multiply by integers. Let's now consider divisions: we wonder if $\congruent{2x}{2y}{12}$ implies $\congruent{x}{y}{12}$. In fact this does not hold, we can see $x = 1$ and $y = 7$ is a counterexample. Indeed, $\congruent{2}{14}{12}$, but $\notcongruent{1}{7}{12}$. Note that we could not use the same argument as for additions, saying $\congruent{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}}{12}$, since $\frac{1}{2}$ is not an integer, and thus does not exist in our world.

    More strangely, $\congruent{5x}{5y}{12}$ implies $\congruent{x}{y}{12}$. Indeed, $\congruent{5}{5}{12}$ and $\congruent{25}{1}{12}$, thus; 
    \[\congruent{5x}{5y}{12} \implies \congruent{25x}{25y}{12} \implies \congruent{x}{y}{12}\]

    Thus, we needed a multiplicative inverse. We can draw its table modulo 12:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c|ccccccccccc}
        $a$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 \\
        \hline
        Inverse & 1 & --- & --- & --- & 5 & --- & 7 & --- & --- & --- & 11
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    
    We observe that the world mod 12 is not a nice place to be.

\parag{Definition: Prime number}{
    A \important{prime number} (or a \important{prime}) is an integer $> 1$ that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. 

    Numbers that are not prime are called \important{composite.}

    \subparag{Remark}{
        1 is not prime since it allows us to get the following nice theorem.
    }
}

\parag{Theorem: Prime factorisation}{
    Every integer greater than 1 has a unique prime factorisation (except for order).

    \subparag{Example}{
        We can draw this as a tree. We can see that $100 = 2\cdot 2\cdot 5\cdot 5$:
        \imagehere[0.4]{PrimeFactorisationTree.png}

        There is no other way of writing 100 using prime factors.
    }

    \subparag{Remark}{
        Note that, in general, it is very hard to compute a prime factorisation. A 1000 bits number cannot be factored with today technology. 

        There is no proof to show that this problem is hard, we only see it (and hope that it holds).

\parag{Definition: Divide}{
    We write $a \divides b$ if $a$ divides $b$, i.e. if $\exists c \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that: 
    \[b = ac\]
    
    Equivalently in terms of prime factors: 
    \[a = p_1^{\gamma_1} \cdots p_n^{\gamma_n}\]
    \[b = p_1^{\widetilde{\gamma}_1} \cdots p_n^{\widetilde{\gamma}_n} \cdot p_{n+1}^{\widetilde{\gamma}_{n+1}} \cdots p_m^{\widetilde{\gamma}_m}\]
    where $\widetilde{\gamma}_i \geq \gamma_i$, for $i = 1, \ldots, n$.
}

\parag{Example}{
    Let the two following numbers: 
    \[168 = 2^3 \cdot 3 \cdot 7, \mathspace 12 = 2^2 \cdot 3\]
    
    Thus, $12 \divides 168$. Let's now consider the two following numbers: 
    \[30 = 2\cdot 3\cdot 5, \mathspace 12 = 2^2 \cdot 3\]
    
    We can see that $12 \ndivides 30$, since $12$ has 2 to the second power whereas 30 only has it to the first power.
}

\parag{Definition: GCD}{
    Let $a$ and $b$ be integers, not both zero. The largest integer that divides both is called the \important{greatest common divisor} (GCD) of $a$ and $b$. It is denoted by $\gcd\left(a, b\right)$.
}

\parag{Theorem}{
    Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers, not both zero, and let $p_1, \ldots, p_k$ be the sequence of prime numbers that divide $a$ or $b$. We already know we can write: 
    \[a = p_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots p_k^{\alpha_k}\]
    \[b = p_1^{\beta_1} \cdots p_k^{\beta_k}\]
    where $\alpha_i \geq 0$ and $\beta_i \geq 0$.

    Then, letting $\gamma_i = \min\left(\alpha_i, \beta_i\right)$, we have:
    \[\gcd\left(a, b\right) = p_1^{\gamma_1} \cdots p_k^{\gamma_k}\]
}

\parag{Example}{
    Let's take the two following numbers: 
    \[12 = 2^2 \cdot 3 = 2^2 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^0\]
    \[30 = 2\cdot 3\cdot 5 = 2^1 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^1\]

    Thus: 
    \[\gcd\left(12, 30\right) = 2^{1} \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^0 = 6\]
}

\parag{Definition: Coprime numbers}{
    Two numbers $a$ and $b$ are called \important{coprime} (or relatively prime, or mutually prime) when: 
    \[\gcd\left(a, b\right) = 1\]
    
    This is equivalent to saying that they have no common prime factor.

    \subparag{Example}{
        We notice that $\gcd\left(9, 100\right) = 1$, thus they are coprime.
    }
}

\parag{Theorem}{
    Let $p$ be a prime number, and let $a$ be an integer such that $0 < a < p$. Then: 
    \[\gcd\left(p, a\right) = 1\]
    
    \subparag{Proof}{
        $p$ only contains $p$ in its prime factorisation, and the one of $a$ cannot contain $p$, since $a < p$.

        \qed
    }
}

\parag{Properties}{
    We wonder if $ab \divides c$ implies $a \divides c$ and $b \divides c$. We can use prime factorisation: 
    \[a = p_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots p_n^{\alpha_n}, \mathspace b = p_1^{\beta_1} \cdots p_n^{\beta_n}, \mathspace c = p_1^{\gamma_1} \cdots p_n^{\gamma_n}\]
    
    Since we know $ab \divides c$, we know that $\gamma_i \geq \alpha_i + \beta_i$ for all $i$. This definitely implies that $\gamma_i \geq \alpha_i$ and $\gamma_i \geq \beta_i$, thus $a \divides c$ and $b \divides c$.

    \vspace{1em}

    We now wonder if $a \divides c$ and $b \divides c$ imply that $ab \divides c$. Using the same prime factorisations, we see that $\gamma_i \geq \alpha_i$ and $\gamma_i \geq \beta_i$ do not imply in general that $\gamma_i \geq \alpha_i + \beta_i$. 

    Modifying a bit our property, we want to know, if $a \divides c$, $b \divides c$ and $\gcd\left(a, b\right) = 1$ imply $ab \divides c$.\label{ref:divisibilityPropertiesForChineseRemaindersTheorem} The hypothesis imply that $\gamma_i \geq \alpha_i$, $\gamma_i \geq \beta_i$, and $\alpha_i > 0 \implies \beta_i = 0$ and $\beta_i > 0 \implies \alpha_i = 0$. This clearly implies that $\gamma_i \geq \alpha_i + \beta_i$.
}

\parag{Theorem: Infinite number of primes}{
    There are an infinite number of primes.

    \subparag{Proof}{
        This proof was made by Euclid in 300 BC. It is usually done by contradiction, but since we are in AICC, let's instead make a procedure that allows us to get an infinite number of primes.
    
        Let's say we have $n$ primes, we will construct one more prime. Let's consider the number $q = p_1 \cdots p_n + 1$. There are two possibilities: either $q$ is a prime, either it is not. In the first case, we have found our new prime number. If $q$ is not prime, then there exists a prime number $p$ and a number $c \geq 1$ such that $q = pc$. If $p$ is not in our list, then we have found a new prime. If $p$ is already in our list, then it means that $p \divides q$ and $p \divides p_1 \cdots p_n = q - 1$, which implies that $p = 1$ (the only numbers that can divide two consecutive numbers is 1). This is impossible since it was a prime number. 

        In any case, we have shown that having $n$ primes allows us to construct an $\left(n+1\right)$th prime. Since we know 2 is a prime, this procedure allows us to construct infinitely many primes (note that the procedure does not necessarily generate all possible primes, it juste generates an infinite number of them).
        
        \qed
