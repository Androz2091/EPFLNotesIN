\section{Sampling}

\parag{Definition: Sampling}{
    Sampling is the process of turning a continuous signal to a discrete one.
    
    \subparag{Example}{
        This is for instance very important when we turn an analogue picture to a digital one, or when we are recording sound. In general, this leads to loss of information, but our goal is to minimise.
    }

    \subparag{Problem}{
        The problem can be represented as the following system, where we have an analog-digital and a digital-analg converter:
        \imagehere[1]{SamplingSystem.png}

        At first, we will simply consider that the system $\mathcal{H}$ is an identity one.
    }
}

\parag{Main idea}{
    Let $T \in \mathbb{R}^*_+$ and some continuous signal $x\left(t\right)$. The main idea is to pick samples at distance $T$ one from another: 
    \[x\left[n\right] = x\left(nT\right)\]
    
    $T$ is named the \important{sampling interval}.

    \subparag{Problem}{
        The main problem we have now is that it seems very hard to reconstruct $x\left(t\right)$ from $x\left[n\right]$: there is an infinite amount of functions which could have been mapped to $x\left[n\right]$. We will thus instead try to pick the simplest function which is coherent.
    }
}

\parag{Example}{
    Let us consider the following continuous signal, which we want to sample with a sampling interval $T = 10$: 
    \[x\left(t\right) = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}t\right)\]
    
    Then, we get that: 
    \[x\left[n\right] = x\left(nT\right) = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5} nT\right) = \cos\left(2\pi\right) = 1\]
    
    Now, to reconstruct this is very hard. By simplicity, we will just try to find the lowest frequency sinusoid that fits the samples, giving: 
    \[x_r\left(t\right) = 1\]
    
    This is not correct because we did not pick a sampling interval too small. This problem is known as \important{aliasing}.
}

\parag{Definition: Sampling frequency}{
    Let $T$ be some sampling interval. Then, the \important{sampling frequency} is: 
    \[\omega_s = \frac{2\pi}{T}\]
}


\parag{Complex exponential}{
    For simplicity, let us try to sample the following continuous signal, with sampling interval $T$: 
    \[x\left(t\right) = \exp\left(j \omega_0 t\right)\]
    
    We see that: 
    \[x\left[n\right] = x\left(nT\right) = \exp\left(j \omega_0 n T\right) = \exp\left(j \left(\omega_0 T\right)n\right) = \exp\left(j \hat{\omega}_0n\right)\]
    where we define $\hat{\omega}_0 = \omega_0 T + 2\pi \ell $ such that $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $-\pi < \hat{\omega}_0 \leq \pi$.

    We now want to reconstruct $x_r\left[n\right]$. We know that we started with an exponential, so we want to end with one too. The thing is, because of the periodicity of complex exponentials, our $x\left[n\right]$ is consistent with sampling any: 
    \[\exp\left(j \left(\frac{\hat{\omega}_0 + 2\pi \ell }{T}\right)t\right), \mathspace \ell \in \mathbb{Z}\]
    
    Again by simplicity, we reconstruct to the lowest frequency, with $\ell = 0$: 
    \[x_r\left(t\right) = \exp\left(j \frac{\hat{\omega}_0}{T}t\right)\]
    
    We notice that $x_r\left(t\right) = x\left(t\right)$ if and only if: 
    \[\frac{\hat{\omega}_0}{T} = \omega_0 \iff \left|\omega_0 T\right| \leq \pi \iff 2 \left|\omega_0\right| \leq \frac{2\pi}{T} = \omega_s\]

    Indeed, in order to have $\hat{\omega}_0 = \omega_0 T$, we need $-\pi < \omega_0 T \leq \pi$ (the $\ell $ in the definition of $\hat{\omega}_0$ must be 0), which indeed implies that $\left|\omega_0 T\right| \leq \pi$.

    Requiring $2 \left|\omega_0\right| \leq \omega_s$ is a condition on the sampling frequency we want to be able to reconstruct without loss which we will want to generalise.
}

\parag{Example}{
    Let us consider the following continuous signal:
    \[x\left(t\right) = e^{j \frac{\pi}{5}t}\]
    
    We notice that, for it to be reconstructed correctly, we need: 
    \[\omega_s = \frac{2\pi}{T} > 2\left|\frac{\pi}{5}\right| \iff T < 5 \]

    For instance, if $T_1 = 4$, we get that everything works correctly: 
    \[x_1\left[n\right] = e^{j \frac{\pi}{5}T_1 n} = e^{j \frac{4}{5}\pi n} \implies x_r\left(t\right) = e^{j\frac{4}{5}\pi \frac{t}{T_1}} = e^{j \frac{\pi}{5}t} = x\left(t\right)\]
    
    However, if $T_2 = 9$, then things no longer work: 
    \[x_2\left[n\right] = e^{j\frac{\pi}{5}T_2 n} = e^{j\frac{9}{5}\pi n} = e^{-j \frac{\pi}{5}n} \implies x_r\left(t\right) = e^{-j \frac{\pi}{5} \frac{t}{T_2}} = e^{-j \frac{\pi}{45}t} \neq x\left(t\right)\]
}

\parag{Linear combination}{
    Let us consider the following continuous signal: 
    \[x\left(t\right) = A_0 e^{j \omega_0 t} + A_1 e^{j\omega_1 t}\]

    Then, we see that: 
    \[x\left[n\right] = A_0 e^{j \omega_0 T n} + A_1 e^{j \omega_1 T n} = A_0 e^{j \frac{\omega_0}{\omega_s} 2\pi n} + A_1 e^{j \frac{\omega_1}{\omega_s} 2\pi n}\]
    
    Since we want to reconstruct both using a linear combination of exponentials with smallest frequency, we need both $\left|\frac{\omega_0}{\omega_s} 2\pi\right| < \pi$ and $\frac{\omega_1}{\omega_s} 2\pi < \pi$, which is equivalent to: 
    \[\omega_s > \max\left\{2\left|\omega_0\right|, 2\left|\omega_1\right|\right\}\]

    \subparag{Remark}{
        Now that we are able to sample linear combination of complex exponential, it seems like we should be able to generalise our result to signals which Fourier transform exists (since a Fourier transform is a continuous linear combination of complex exponentials).
    }
    
}

\parag{Definition: Band-limited signal}{
    A band-limited signal is a continuous signal which Fourier transform exists, and for which there exists an $\omega_M \in \mathbb{R}$ such that:
    \[x\left(t\right) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} X\left(\omega\right) e^{j \omega t} d\omega = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\omega_M}^{\omega_M} X\left(\omega\right) e^{j \omega t} d\omega\]
    
    In other words, $X\left(\omega\right) = 0$ for all $\left|\omega\right| > \omega_M$.
}

\parag{Definition: Impulse train}{
    An \important{impulse train} signal is a signal of the form: 
    \[p\left(t\right) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta\left(t - nT\right)\]
    for some $T \in \mathbb{R}$.

    We notice that, the bigger $T$, the farther the $\delta$ will be one-another.

    \subparag{Fourier transform}{
        The Fourier transform of the impulse train is: 
        \[P\left(\omega\right) = \frac{2\pi}{T} \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta\left(\omega - \frac{2\pi k}{T}\right)\]

        We notice that, the bigger $T$, the closer the $\delta$ will be one-another.
    }
}

\parag{Bandlimited interpolation}{
    Let $x\left(t\right)$ be some signal we want to sample, and $T$ be the sampling interval.

    We take our sampled signal as: 
    \[x_p\left(t\right) = x\left(t\right)p\left(t\right) = x\left(t\right)\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta\left(t - nT\right) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x\left(t\right)\delta\left(t - nT\right) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x\left(nT\right) \delta\left(t - nT\right)\]
    
    This looks like: 
    \imagehere[0.7]{SampledSignalArrows.png}

    We notice that $x_p\left(t\right)$ is equivalent to $x\left[n\right] = x\left(nT\right)$; they both have the exact same amount of information since there is a bijection between the two. We will thus analyse $x\left[n\right]$ by analysing $x_p\left(t\right)$.

    Let us consider the Fourier transform of $x_p\left(t\right)$: 
    \autoeq{X_p\left(\omega\right) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\left(X\left(\omega\right) * P\left(\omega\right)\right) = \frac{1}{2\pi} X\left(\omega\right) * \left(\frac{2\pi}{T} \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta\left(\omega - \frac{2\pi k}{T}\right)\right) = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} \left(X\left(\omega\right) * \delta\left(\omega - \omega_s k\right)\right) = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} X\left(\omega - \omega_s k\right)}

    For instance, the magnitude of our Fourier transform may look like:
    \imagehere{SamplingAliasing.png}

    We are thus creating many copies of our original Fourier transform, and at some places they will overlap and we will thus loose some information; this creates aliasing. To avoid loosing any information, we need those to be spaced out enough.

    So, if $x\left(t\right)$ is a bandlimited signal, meaning that there exists a $\omega_M$ such that $X\left(\omega\right) = 0$ for all $\left|\omega\right| > \omega_M$, we only need to take $\omega_s > 2 \omega_M$.
    \imagehere{SamplingNoAliasing.png}

    In that case, to reconstruct the signal, we can simply apply a low-pass filter, $H\left(\omega\right)$: 
    \begin{functionbypart}{H\left(\omega\right)}
        T, & \left|\omega\right| < \omega_c \\
        0, & \left|\omega\right| > \omega_c
    \end{functionbypart}
    where the cut-off frequency can be anywhere $\omega_M < \omega_c < \omega_s - \omega_M$
    
    In that case, we simply have $X_r\left(\omega\right) = H\left(\omega\right) H_p\left(\omega\right)$, which is such that $X_r\left(\omega\right) = X\left(\omega\right)$ by construction. 

    In the time domain, our low-pass filter looks like: 
    \[h\left(t\right) =  \frac{\omega_c T \sin\left(\omega_c t\right)}{\pi \omega_c t}\]
    
    We can apply it to recover our original signal (if we indeed have $\omega_s > 2 \omega_M$): 
    \autoeq{x_r\left(t\right) = \left(h* x_p\right)\left(t\right) = \left(h * \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x\left(nT\right)\delta\left(t - nT\right)\right) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x\left(nT\right)h\left(t - nT\right) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x\left(nT\right) \frac{\omega_c T}{\pi} \frac{\sin\left(\omega_c\left(t - nT\right)\right)}{\omega_c\left(t - nT\right)}}
    
    This is named bandlimited interpolation, and this is another instance of a problem which is definitely easier to think of in the frequency domain than in the time domain.
}

\parag{Sampling theorem}{
    Let $x\left(t\right)$ be a bandlimited signal, meaning $X\left(\omega\right) = 0$ for $\left|\omega\right| > \omega_M$.

    It is uniquely determined by its samples $x\left(nT\right)$ if: 
    \[\omega_s > 2 \omega_M\]
    where $\omega_s = \frac{2\pi}{T}$.

    \subparag{Remark}{
        $\omega_s = 2 \omega_M$ is named the \important{Nyquist rate}.
    }

    \subparag{Formulas}{
        We found that that we can sample:
        \[x\left[n\right] = x\left(nT\right)\]

        If we indeed have $\omega_s > 2 \omega_M$, then we can recover our signal by using bandlimited interpolation: 
        \[x\left(t\right) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x\left[n\right] \frac{\omega_c T}{\pi} \frac{\sin\left(\omega_c\left(t - nT\right)\right)}{\omega_c\left(t - nT\right)}\]
    }
    
}

\parag{Example 1}{
    Let us consider the following signal again: 
    \[x\left(t\right) = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}t\right)\]
    
    We noticed that sampling it with a sampling interval $T = 10$ was not correct. Let's analyse this with our new tools.

    We know that its Fourier transform is: 
    \[X\left(\omega\right) = \pi\left(\delta\left(\omega - \frac{\pi}{5}\right) + \delta\left(\omega + \frac{\pi}{5}\right)\right)\]
    
    This is a bandlimited signal with $\omega_M = \frac{\pi}{5}$. We thus need: 
    \[\omega_s = \frac{2\pi}{T} > 2 \omega_M = \frac{2\pi}{5} \implies T < 5\]
    
    Indeed, $T = 10$ could not work. Let's now see what happens in the frequency domain. We developed that the sample signal in the frequency domain is of the form: 
    \[X_p\left(\omega\right) = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} X\left(\omega - \omega_s k\right)\]
    
    This looks like:
    \imagehere[0.7]{SamplingAliasingExample.png}

    We see that, indeed, we have some clutter, we don't have just $X\left(\omega\right)$ in $\left]-\omega_M, \omega_M\right[ $ (in fact, the black arrows from $X\left(\omega\right)$ are outside this interval, and all we have is an arrow from $X\left(\omega - \omega_s\right)$ in blue and one from $X\left(\omega + \omega_s\right)$ in green). In fact, applying a low-pass filter, we get: 
    \[X_r\left(\omega\right) = \frac{2\pi}{T} \delta\left(t\right) \implies x_r\left(t\right) = 1 \neq x\left(t\right)\]
    exactly as what we had got before.
}

\parag{Example 2}{
    Let us consider the exact same signal, but with a sampling interval $T =4$: 
    \[x\left(t\right) = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}t\right)\]
    
    We indeed have: 
    \[\omega_s = \frac{2\pi}{T} = \frac{\pi}{2} > \frac{2\pi}{5} = 2 \omega_M\]
    
    Now, in the frequency domain, we have:
    \imagehere[0.7]{SamplingNoAliasingExample.png}

    Applying a low-pass filter, we indeed get the Fourier transform $X\left(\omega\right)$, which yields that $x_r\left(t\right) = x\left(t\right)$.
